# embroidery-essential

I want this app to be embroiderer's best friend. I'm a fellow embroiderer and found a need to keep all my info in one place. Current plan is to include features:
* Login page
* Projects
  * Timer to track time in project (not MVP)
  * Add used thread colours
  * Track start and finish dates
  * Note your budget and basic info
* Thread colour palettes (not MVP)
* Shopping list
  * Adding thread colours from thread collection
  * Input for user's text
* Threads in stock
  * Search threads in stock
  * Add thread colours to shopping list
* Thread colours aka Thread Colours Substitutes (you can find demo [here](https://edworczak.github.io/embroiderer-essential/))
  * Search thread colours
  * Add colours to stock or shopping list
* Utility pages
  * Settings
  * Help
  * Profile

If you have any ideas on your own raise them in [Issues](https://github.com/edworczak/ebroiderers-essential/issues) section. If you speak Polish join our handcraft Discord server [Koło Gospodyń Internetowych](https://discord.gg/HqNVstmPDV).

## Development
